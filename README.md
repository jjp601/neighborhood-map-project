# Neighborhood Map Project

The Neighborhood Map project was built as part of the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree program. The Neighborhood Map application displays all of my favorite restaurants in my hometown area using the Google Maps API. You can search a restaurant in the list to narrow down the view of restaurants on the map. When you click on a map marker it will display information about the restaurant and a photo from Foursquare using the Foursquare API. In addition a link is provided to checkout the restaurant on the Foursquare website. The map is also responsive and works on multiple screen sizes. You may visit the application [here](https://jjp601.github.io/neighborhood-map-project/).

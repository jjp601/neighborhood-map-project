# Neighborhood Map Project

The Neighborhood Map project was built as part of the Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree program. The Neighborhood Map application displays all of my favorite restaurants in my hometown area using the Google Maps API. You can search a restaurant in the list to narrow down the view of restaurants on the map. When you click on a map marker it will display information about the restaurant and a photo from Foursquare using the Foursquare API. In addition a link is provided to checkout the restaurant on the Foursquare website. The map is also responsive and works on multiple screen sizes. You can reset the map view to better view the markers on different screen sizes by resetting the map.
